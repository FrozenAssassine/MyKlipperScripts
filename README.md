## Klipper config files for my 3d printers.

- Ender 5 Pro (0.4mm)
- Ender 3 V2 (0.4mm)
- Raise3D N2 Plus custom mod with Robin Nano V3 mainboard (0.6mm)

All of the printers use a BL-touch for bed leveling and meshing.
Every start gcode has a purgeline with a purge blob afterwards.
Every printer has direct drive and the ESteps are calibrated for this specific setup.
Vibration compensation is also done for all the printers and the recommended filters are activated.
All printers have a fan mod for 5015 fans for better part cooling and faster printing without losing quality.
